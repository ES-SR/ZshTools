# @args:parse: A Lightweight Zsh Argument Parser

@args:parse is a powerful, lightweight, and idiomatic argument parser for Zsh. It's designed as a flexible toolkit, not a rigid framework. It handles the tedious parts of parsing and then gets out of your way, allowing you to use standard shell features to implement your script's logic in a clean and powerful way. üöÄ


## Features

    **No Dependencies:** Written in pure Zsh.

    **Automatic Flag Generation:** Automatically creates patterns for long (--verbose) and short (-v) flags.

    **Powerful Specifications:** Control the number of arguments a flag takes (file=1, exec=*).

    **Occurrence Counting:** Boolean flags naturally count how many times they are used, perfect for verbosity levels.

    **Subcommand & DSL Patterns:** The design makes it trivial to create scripts with subcommands (e.g., git push ...).

    **Built-in Array Iterators:** Every parsed flag array automatically gets iterator aliases (:next, :previous, :cycle) for free.


## Installation

There are two ways to use the parser in your scripts:

1.  **Simple Sourcing (Recommended for standalone scripts):**
Simply save the parser code to a file (e.g., `args_parser.zsh`) and source it at the top of your script:
```zsh
source /path/to/your/args_parser.zsh
```

2.  **Standard `fpath` Installation (Recommended for shared functions):**     For a more robust, system-wide installation that follows standard Zsh practices:     * Save the parser script into a file named exactly `@args:parse`.     * Move this file into a directory included in your Zsh function path (`$fpath`), such as `~/.zsh/functions`.     * Ensure your `.zshrc` contains the line: `fpath=(~/.zsh/functions $fpath)`


## Core Usage

You use the parser by calling its alias within your script. It reads the shell's `$argv` array, processes it according to your specifications, and creates new arrays in your shell's scope that hold the results.

The basic syntax is:
@args:parse 'spec1' 'spec2' ...

**Example:**
```zsh
#!/bin/zsh
# Assume this script is called with: --verbose --file /tmp/log.txt data.csv
@args:parse verbose 'file=1'

# The post-parsing environment now contains these variables:
# typeset -a verbose=(1)
# typeset -a file=('/tmp/log.txt')
# typeset -a argv=('data.csv')
```


## The Post-Parsing Environment

After `@args:parse` runs, it modifies your shell's environment in three key ways:

1.  **Flag Arrays Are Created:** The parser creates arrays for each matched flag (e.g., `verbose`, `file`) containing their respective values or counts.

2.  **`argv` is Cleaned:** All flags and any arguments they consumed are removed from the `$argv` array. The `argv` array is then repopulated with only the remaining positional arguments, in their original order.

3.  **Iterators Are Attached:** The full iterator interface (`:next`, `:previous`, etc.) is automatically attached to every flag array created AND to the final `argv` array, allowing you to easily cycle through all parsed results.


## Flag Specification Syntax

You define how flags are parsed by providing string specifications.

### Boolean Flags
A flag name by itself is treated as a boolean that counts its occurrences. The result is a **single-element array** containing the total count. As with all flags, **each matched instance is removed** from the final `$argv` array.

* **Spec:** `verbose`     * Usage: `./script -v --verbose other-arg`     * Result: `verbose=(2)`, `argv=(other-arg)`

### Flags with a Maximum Number of Arguments
Use `\=N` to specify that a flag takes a maximum of `N` arguments.

* **Spec:** `file=1`     * Usage: `./script --file /etc/hosts`     * Result: `file=(/etc/hosts)`

### Flags That Consume All Following Arguments
Use `\=*` to have a flag consume all subsequent arguments until it hits the next flag. This is the key to creating subcommands.

* **Spec:** `exec=`      Usage: `./script --exec ls -l /tmp`     * Result: `exec=(ls -l /tmp)`

### Flags with Custom Patterns (Advanced)
You can provide your own regex pattern. The `+` characters are used as delimiters and are not part of the pattern itself.

* **Spec:** `+(-|--)i(n(clude|)|)+include=`      Usage: Matches `-i`, `--in`, and `--include`.     * Result: `include=(...)`


## Examples üí°

### Common Use Cases

#### Simple Help Flag
This pattern executes a `help` function if `--help` or `-h` is found.
```zsh
help() {
  cat <<-"EndOfHelp"
  USAGE: ./my_script [options] <file>
  
  Options:
    --verbose, -v   Enable verbose output.
    --help, -h      Show this help message.
  EndOfHelp
}

@args:parse Help

# Use (( $#Help )) to robustly check if the flag was present.
(( $#Help )) && { help; exit 0; }
```

#### Handling Input/Output Files
A classic use case for a flag that takes a single argument.
```zsh
@args:parse 'input=1' 'output=1'

# Use default values if flags are not provided
: ${input:="stdin"}
: ${output:="stdout"}

print "Reading from '$input[1]' and writing to '$output[1]'."
```

### Advanced Patterns & Techniques üöÄ

#### Subcommand Dispatcher
By naming flags after your functions, you can create elegant `git`-like interfaces.
```zsh
# Define functions to act as subcommands
push() { print "Executing: git push $@" }
commit() { print "Executing: git commit -m '$1'" }

# Use '=1' for commit (takes one message) and '=*' for push (takes multiple args)
@args:parse 'commit=1' 'push=*'

# Dispatcher logic
(( $#commit )) && commit "${commit[@]}"
(( $#push )) && push "${push[@]}"

# USER INVOCATION:
# ./git-helper.sh --commit "Initial commit" --push origin main
```

#### Multi-Level Verbosity Control
This shows two powerful ways to handle verbosity.

**1. Using a `case` Statement:**
```zsh
@args:parse verbose

case ${verbose[1]:-0} in
  1) print "Verbosity level 1: Basic status messages." ;;
  2) print "Verbosity level 2: Detailed debug output." ;;
  3) set -x ;; # Level 3 enables xtrace
esac
```

**2. Dynamic Output Redirection:**
```zsh
# Define output targets. Index 1 is for no verbosity (level 0).
VerboseTargets=(/dev/null /dev/stderr /proc/self/fd/1)
@args:parse 'Verbose=3'

# Redirect fd 3 to the chosen target based on the number of -v flags.
exec 3>$VerboseTargets[${Verbose[1]:-0}+1]

# Now, you can selectively write to the verbose stream.
print -u 3 "This is a verbose message."
```

#### Pro Tip: Namespacing Functions and Variables
Because the parser's pattern matching is case-insensitive but the variable creation is case-sensitive (it uses the name from your spec), you can create a powerful separation between a function and its corresponding flag variable.
```zsh
# A function named 'verbose' in all lowercase
verbose() {
  print -u 3 -P "%F{cyan}VERBOSE:%f $@"
}

# A spec using 'Verbose' with a capital V
@args:parse Verbose

# Now, 'verbose' is the function, and '$Verbose' is the array!
(( $#Verbose )) && verbose "Verbose mode is on (level ${Verbose[1]})."
```


## Future Direction: The "Parser 2.0" Vision üó∫Ô∏è

This parser is an evolving project. The planned next major version aims to move from creating individual global variables for each flag to building a unified **tree data structure**.

This architectural shift would transform the parser from a "flag processor" to an **"argument data structure builder,"** providing several key benefits:

* **Clean Namespace:** All parsed data would live under a single entry point (e.g., `Args`), preventing pollution of the global variable space. Instead of `$verbose` and `$file`, you would access `Args:Flags:verbose` and `Args:Flags:file`.     * Rich Metadata: The tree structure makes it easy to attach metadata to the parsed results, such as the order in which flags appeared, the specific pattern that matched a flag, or overall parsing statistics.     * Multi-Level Iteration: The existing iterator system would be integrated directly into the tree, allowing for powerful, hierarchical iteration:
```zsh
# Cycle through the names of all flags that were found
Args:Flags:next

# Cycle through the values of a specific flag
Args:Flags:SomeFlagName:next
```

This future direction aims to make the post-parsing environment even more powerful, organized, and intuitive to work with.
